= Ingo: A static site generator built on http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor]

Ingo converts AsciiDoc files in a directory and converts them using http://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor].
It is built for collecting notes in AciiDoc format and presenting them.

It is recommended to add `topics` to each file.

For example

----
:topics: gardening, hobby, shopping
----

defines three topics.
Ingo will create an index file for each topic linking to all documents with that topic.
Think of topics as "Categories" in wikipedia.
Ingo is meant to provide an alternative to wikis for note taking for individuals and teams.
In combination with Github/Gitlab and a CI service it can provide a similar experience for technical users.
